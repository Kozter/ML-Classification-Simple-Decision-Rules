ML Decision Rules

1. Write a source code that implements a Decision Rules Algorithm (particularly, classification rules based on the numerical attributes; find the simplest decision tree).

2. The program should be able to provide Training of the Algorithm based on the training data and  Classification  of the selected data based on the trained model.  

Classification - means giving a class label to the unlabeled data samples from the file. The input of the program:
files with train and test data samples; output: labels for the corresponding test data sample from
the file.

3. Print the generated decision rules in a concise format, and find the optimal accuracy.
